# 2box_dot_com_demo

A mini app intended to illustrate incorporating Box.com into a Flutter app -- using the Oauth2 REST API from Box.com.

## Getting Started

You will want to create an account and an app at developer.box.com. The app should be a "custom app" intended for individuals and potentially affording any/all possible scopes.
